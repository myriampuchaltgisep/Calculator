# Calculator

Write some code to calculate a result from a set of instructions that are loaded from file and results are output to the screen.

Instructions should be the add, divide, multiply and subtract operators, ignoring mathematical precedence. The last instruction should be "apply" and a number (e.g., "apply 3"). The calculator is then initialised with that number and the previous instructions are applied to that number.

## Example 

```
[Input from file]
add 5
multiply 2
apply 4

[Output to screen]
18

[Explanation]
(4 + 5) * 2 = 18
```
